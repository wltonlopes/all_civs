# all_civs
This mod aims to add several "minor" civilizations to the 0a.d. mainly those that existed next to great civilizations that already exist today in the 0a.d. Many of them will initially be re-skins of nearby civs with the main differences in their bonuses, units, special buildings and heroes.
