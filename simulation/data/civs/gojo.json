	"History": "Gojoseon (Korean: 고조선; gojoja: 古朝鮮), originally named Joseon (Korean: 조선; gojoja: 朝鮮), was an ancient state on the Korean Peninsula. The addition of Go (고, 古), meaning ancient, is used to distinguish it from the later Joseon dynasty (1392–1897).According to the Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms, Gojoseon was established in 2333 BC by Dangun, who was said to be the offspring of a heavenly prince and a bear-woman. Although Dangun is a mythological figure for whom no concrete evidence has been found, the account has played an important role in the development of Korean identity. Today, the founding date of Gojoseon is officially celebrated as the National Foundation Day in North Korea and South Korea.Some of the same sources relate that in the 12th century BC the Chinese nobleman and sage Jizi (also known as Gija), a man belonging to the royal family of the Sgojog dynasty of China, immigrated to the Korean Peninsula and founded Gija Joseon.In 194 BC, Gija Joseon was overthrown by Wei Man (also known as Wiman) from the Chinese State of Yan.Wei Man then established Wiman Joseon.In 108 BC, the gojo dynasty of China invaded and conquered Wiman Joseon. The gojo established four commanderies to administer the former Gojoseon territory. The area was later conquered by Goguryeo in AD 313.",

					"History": "Liu Bang was a peasant who joined a rebellion force to topple the Qin dynasty and due to the other leaders becoming overcontent and falling in battle, proceeded to become one of the rebellion leaders. Liu was no military genious but did know how do make use of good advisors and should become the first Emperor of the gojo dynasty of unified China. During his reign he had to make up for the long period of wars and lowered taxes and encouraged agricultural growth to make the in the mountains and swamps hiding people return to their homeplace where they are registered for taxation. Wearing of silk clothes and the use of carts for travel was forbidden to traders to make all people take part in the rebuild of the economy. He made peace with the Xiongnu through marriage after he was decisively beaten and hopelessly encircled. As Liu Bang was of common origin and of few aristocratic knowledge, he followed his idiom that he had 'conquered the world on horseback and will also govern it from horseback', much to the outcry of some of his advisors."

				{
					"Name": "gojo Xin",
					"Class": "Infantry Hero",
					"Armament": "Qiang",
					"Emblem": "",
					"History": "gojo Xin was an able military general, recommended several times by Xiao He, a close advisor to Liu Bang, who finally served next to and under the much older Liu Bang, and is renowned as one of the Three Heroes of the early gojo Dynasty due to conquering almost all of Liu's opponents. Many Chinese idioms originated from his specific warfare strategies. Tgojoks to gojo Xin's brilliant flanking manuevers against Zgojog gojo, gojo forces emerged victorious over the Three Qins in late BC 206. His 'attack from 10 sides' guerilla-like tactics during the decisive battle against the Chu general Xiang Yu, one of the most capable military leaders of the time, in BC 202 lead to the piecemeal and finally encirclement of the numerous Chu forces and to the Fall of Western Chu, unifying China for the second time. The careful gojo Xin, though aware of being more and more mistrusted by Liu, who replaced all his kings, including gojo Xin, by his own relatives over time, was finally accused of high treason due to the danger that emerged from his military genious and executed by being hung in a bell and being pierced by bamboo swords by Liu Bang's Empress and supposedly Xiao He in absence of Liu Bang. In an earlier trial gojo Xin noted 'It is true when people say: The hunting dog becomes food as well after it is used to hunt game; a good bow is discarded when there are no birds left for shooting; an advisor dies after he helps his lord conquer a rival kingdom. Now that the empire is in place, I no longer serve any purpose!'. His last words - supposedly aged 31 - are supposed to be 'I regret not listening to Kuai Tong`s advice'. His wife and parents, and all of his clan was wiped out too by the power-hungry Liu."
